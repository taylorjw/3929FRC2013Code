     * example, A = Analog, DPWM = Digital PWM, DRelay = Digital Relays,
     * DIO = Digital I/O(Pretty self-explanatory)
     *
     *       As for the actual sensors,
     * it is easy to read them, but you should probably memorize them.
     * Potential = Potentiometer, LimSwitch = Limit Switch,
     * LightSensor = Light Sensor, Encoder = Encoder, Victor = Victor,
     * Jag = Jaguar, Spike = Spike
     *
     *      (There are numbers after each to say which version of sensor we are
     * referring to; ie. Jaguar1; That said, we must keep this code commented
     * so we know which sensors perform what function)
     * 
     *      Finally, the mechanism that the sensor is devoted to is given in 
     * its name.  This should be memorized as well.  arm = Arm, 
     * ballDet = Ball Detection, drive = Drive, shooter = Shooter, 
     * ballIn = Ball Intake
     *      
     *       (Potentiometers do not have mechanisms in their code name.)
     * To conclude, the order for naming a sensor is
     * (Type of sensor group in caps)_(mechanism name)(Sensor name)(# of sensor)
